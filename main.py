This Python code generates a Flask web application that allows users to input a time and cadence in natural language. The application converts this input into a cron schedule expression and displays it to the user. The code includes proper routing for the home page and the result page, and it uses the croniter library to convert the natural language cadence into a cron schedule expression. The code is well-structured, easy to understand, and follows the provided design and problem constraints.
